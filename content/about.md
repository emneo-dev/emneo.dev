# Hi there

My name is Alexandre Flion (huntears) and I administrate this website.

I am a 20 years old student at Epitech Toulouse, currently abroad in the Netherlands to study.

I speak French, English, and a tiny bit of Spanish (I am currently learning Dutch but my knowledge
currently stops at asking for a kapsalon at the local d√∂ner).

I am a big FOSS advocate and try to self host as much as possible while trying to get away from
big tech corporations. I also am the Lead Developer on CubicServer, a Minecraft's server reimplementation
in C++.

You can find me on the fediverse (@huntears@fosstodon.org), and on matrix (@huntears:matrix.org).

So, there you have it... enjoy!

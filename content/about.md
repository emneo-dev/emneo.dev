# Hi there

My name is Alexandre Flion (huntears), I am a 20 years old student at Epitech
Toulouse in 5th year and I administrate this website.

I speak French, English, and a tiny bit of Spanish (I am currently learning
Dutch but my knowledge currently stops at asking for a kapsalon at the local
d√∂ner).

I am a big FOSS advocate and try to self host as much as possible while trying
to get away from big tech corporations. I also am the Lead Developer on
cubic-server, a Minecraft's server reimplementation in C++.

You can find me on the fediverse (@huntears@fosstodon.org), on matrix
(@huntears:matrix.org) and on discord (huntears).

So, there you have it... enjoy!

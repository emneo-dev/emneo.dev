# Hi there

I am emneo, a 22 years old FOSS enthusiast currently working at Epitech
Toulouse and I administrate this website.

I speak French, English, and a tiny bit of Spanish (I am currently learning
Dutch but my knowledge currently stops at asking for a kapsalon at the local
d√∂ner).

I am a big FOSS advocate and try to self host as much as possible while trying
to get away from big tech corporations. I am also the Lead Developer on
liskvork, a modern cross-platform game server for Gomoku (still very early.)

You can find me on the fediverse (@emneo@fosstodon.org) and on discord
(emneo-dev).

So, there you have it... enjoy!

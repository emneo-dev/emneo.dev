      <h1>Why Python might be the best choice for your next project</h1>
      <aside>
        Python is often seen as a beginner only programming language, but here
        is a few reasons why you should choose it for your own projects.

        <h2>Speed</h2>
        <p>
          Most of the benchmarks you will find on the Internet will depict
          Python as a very slow language, and they wouldn't be totally wrong.
          Because people do not understand that writing pure Python code for
          time sensitive applications is not a good idea, you indeed need to use
          built-ins as much as you can.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed the way Python is supposed to be used is kind of different from
          other languages (And more specifically compiles languages like C, C++,
          or Rust for example), as you need to see it not as a programming
          language in itself, but as a scripting engine. You need to imagine the
          code as Python linking different built-ins to make sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might think that it is a really bad idea to write code this way,
          though it is not. Indeed many big libraries and frameworks which are
          time sensitive manage to get good speeds while using Python. I can
          cite Django for example, which is currently used by Youtube and
          Patreon (There may be others, but those are the ones I know of right
          now). And here Youtube is a really big time sensitive application,
          which shows that Python isn't slow by itself, it's the way people
          write it that make it slow.
        </p>

        <h2>Readability</h2>
        <p>
          Like most people say, it is a beginner friendly language. No curly
          braces, no semicolons, just plain non obfuscated code just here to
          be as simple as possible. In itself the language follows what I wrote
          just above: it's not a programming language, it's a scripting engine;
          Therefore the written code is supposed to be small and as
          understandable as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the zen of Python: Simple is better than complex.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Extendability</h2>
        <p>
          The Python community is very active and quite old now, and you will
          always find people who are willing to help you with your problems.
          Since it is very popular the quantity of libraries and frameworks
          available is quite high, and you will most likely find what is suited
          for your needs quite easily.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Python is as you have read a very good choice, and you should think
          about it twice before using another language when you could replace
          it with a fast, readable, and extensible language like Python.

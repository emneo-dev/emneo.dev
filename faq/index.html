            <h2 id="q1">Why this simple of a design for your website, why not have something <span style="font-style: italic">fancier</span>?<a class="note" href="#q1">[1]</a></h2>
            <p>
                Because I prefer the simpler web, the one which you can load in less than a second.
                Today's websites lean way too much upon big framework which slow down the whole
                structure and make everything feel bad/wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this website I just wanted to have a basic design, that is readable (so no bare html)
                but also is very lighweight. The design i sought after was a simpler version
                of <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> while having a load time equivalent to
                the biggest inspiration to this website : <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com">motherfuckingwebsite.com</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I finally settled on the design of <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com</a>
                (which I literally took the whole 11 lines of css from) which was literally all I
                wanted : A simple design, easy to read, fast to load. I might do changes later but as for
                now (08/09/2021) it looks really good.
